Long before it could blame its troubles on an airline advertising campaign, the two-foot tall Australian marsupial was hunted almost to extinction for its furry pelt. Only since the koala was declared a protected species in the late 1920's has it made something of a comeback. So perhaps the koala could be forgiven for thinking that life might be more bearable if it was closer to the size of a real bear.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In fact, it once was. Rooting around a southern Australian cave in 1985, spelunker Graham Pilkington uncovered a fossilized jaw fragment of a creature later identified as a giant koala, which probably inhabited the continent more than a million years ago. The jawbone and front molars are about twice the size of those of a present-day koala. This suggests that the creature was more than three feet tall and weighed between 45 and 65 pounds. Not exactly a grizzly bear, but about two to three times as heavy as modern koalas. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Still, as the curator of fossils at the South Australian Museum explains, this larger size may have been a mixed blessing. Although the giant koala was perhaps better equipped to ward off foes, it probably subsisted on the same diet of eucalyptus leaves its descendants favor. Not all eucalyptus branches could have supported that much weight, so dining out could have been an adventure for a giant koala. Worse still, late in the Pleistocene period, a series of droughts ravaged southeastern Australia, wiping out many species including the giant koala. Hardier and requiring less sustenance, only smaller members of the koala family survived.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Some of these link up with ordinary oxygen molecules and form ozone. Some rejoin other free singles and revert to stable molecules. This Sun-energy process, if left undisturbed, maintains a fairly constant supply of ozone above the Earth's surface. The ozone layer begins about eight miles up and is distributed thinly to about thirty miles up. This lofty umbrella of ozone shields the Earth from much of the Sun's deadly ultraviolet rays. Without the ozone cover, life on Earth would be literally sunburned to death.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some scientists believe that relatively small amounts of synthetic chemicals, such as spray-can fluorocarbon or jet exhaust, reach the upper limits of the atmosphere and break down the three-atom ozone molecules. It is also believed that just one atom of spray-can or jet pollutant can affect vast numbers of ozone molecules.

In ancient Egypt, however, the few who exerted more than nominal power possessed extraordinary qualities. One of the first women of distinction was Hatshepsut, the only woman pharaoh in history, who ruled Egypt between 1503 and 1482 B.C. Whereas previous Egyptian consorts had used indirected influence in government, Hatshepsut ruled openly after her husband, the pharaoh, died. She was sufficiently influential to exercise supreme power when she became regent to her husband's six-year-old son.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hatshepsut surrounded herself with people of outstanding administrative and intellectual abilities. When she renounced the regency and declared herself pharaoh, she successfully challenged the 2,000-year-old tradition of masculine rule in an extremely conservative civilization.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She also avoided what had been the pharaoh's major occupation, waging war. Her 20-year reign was devoted to peace and prosperity. She encouraged agriculture and trade and established sea routes to replace long, arduous, overland journeys. The arts, especially architecture, flourished under her patronage, as her funerary temple at Deir al-Bahri and the two obelisks at Karnak demonstrate.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When she died, her constructive influence ended and her husband's son became pharaoh. He smashed her statues and erased her name from monuments, thus belittling Queen Hatshepsut's accomplishments. To this day, Hatshepsut is less renowned even though she was a far more capable ruler than the famous Queen Cleopatra.</p>\n</div>\n",

The survival of the company and the way it has found a secure place in an increasingly crowded dance world are considerable accomplishments. Of greater significance, though, are the consistently high levels of the company's dancing and the unfailing enthusiasm of each performer. Of all the ballet companies that regularly appear in New York, it shows the least danger of succumbing to routine.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem is animated by a sense of purpose that is largely moral in nature. In the midst of the despair that followed the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in 1968, Mitchell was determined to give Black people a place in ballet. He sought to help other Black dancers so that they would not have to face the difficulties he faced.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nobody was better qualified than Mitchell to understand what Black dancers could do in ballet if given the incentive and the opportunity, and time has proved his faith well-founded. But Mitchell is too shrewd an artistic administrator and too serious an artist not to know that the only standard he and his company can in the long run be guided by is artistic. As he said in an interview, \". . . maybe, eventually, we'll get to the day when Dance Theater of Harlem is no longer thought of as a good Black company, but a good ballet company.\"</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That day, so far as I'm concerned, has already arrived.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n",

Thus the need for privacy may eventually be completely submerged in the overpowering need to be with. When such an annihilation of privacy is achieved, a person is, indeed, in danger of self-annihilation, of becoming a living automaton at the mercy of anyone who knows how to make him or her tick. In such a society one becomes grateful to \"Big Brother\" for assuming the task of directing the life one is no longer capable of directing oneself. In this way does the annihilation of privacy lead to the annihilation of the person, and of society; for the healthy society depends up on the ability of individuals to think and reflect upon what true society is -- and without the privacy to think and reflect, people and society are lost.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Actually, not all are islands, many are peninsulas or sand spits with tenuous connections to the mainland. The barriers include some of the country's bleakest yet most beautiful beaches, as well as many that are depressing waterfront strips of high-rise apartments and fast-food places.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But now many barrier beaches are washing away, largely because too many people are living on them. Communities that once faced broad seashores now huddle behind stone walls, just yards from the ocean. Construction of seawalls helps save houses but ultimately destroys beaches by ignoring an unalterable fact -- it is natural for barrier beaches to move. High seas and powerful storms normally fling sand from the front of the island toward the sound behind, slowly pushing the barrier back over on itself. The barriers have been shifting this way ever since they were formed. Any structure built to hold the beaches in place interferes with powerful ocean forces and ends up increasing erosion it was meant to prevent.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The dilemma of the barrier beaches is that whether people leave them alone or try to mold them to suit human needs, someone loses. One way out of the dilemma is to move the cottages and resorts off the beach. Abandoning the beaches seems an admission of defeat, but no human is match for the ocean. Many miles of beaches have already been irreversibly destroyed. We now are confronted with two mutually exclusive choices -- buildings or beaches.</p>\n</div>\n",

Nevertheless, many demographers assert that generalizations about the distinct characters of birth groups are helpful for social analysis. They aid in designing policy and education targeted toward the unique characteristics of specific cohorts. A case in point are those born between 1981 and 2000, dubbed \"The Millennial Generation\" because they are the first adults of the 21st century. According to the Pew Research Center, a think tank, the current group of 13- to 29-year-olds is more ethnically and racially diverse than any other similarly-aged cohort in our history. Many believe this explains their tendency to see themselves as global citizens. Millennials have been described as \"digital natives\" because of their total comfort with technology. This is in stark contrast with previous generations, such as the Silent Generation, born before 1946; the Baby Boomers, born during the spike in births between 1946-1964 that followed World War II; or even Generation X, born between 1965-1980. Millennials inhabit a world where personal devices have always existed and are all around us, as ubiquitous as the air we breathe. Because two-thirds of Millennials voted for Barack Obama for president in 2008, some suggest that Millennials are more politically progressive than previous generations. While some authors call Millennials narcissistic, others believe rather that this generation is notably unselfish and eager to be of service to others. Many sociologists believe that understanding Millennials will make those who work with them more productive citizens.</p>\n</div>\n",
