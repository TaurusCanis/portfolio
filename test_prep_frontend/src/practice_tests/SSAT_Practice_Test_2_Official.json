Every characteristic that could be distinguished in the man was apparent in the pianist—the same precision; the horror of excess and all that is careless and uncontrolled; the same good manners and high tone of character, combined with poetic warmth and a romantic fervor of expression. No one had ever heard such polished playing, although others could make a more overwhelming impression by their rush and violence. It is a mistake, encouraged by sentimental legend, to believe that Chopin’s playing was limited by a delicacy which was equivalent to weakness. Even in the last stages of tuberculosis, he could rally and play with an energy that surprised the audience, who saw in front of them “a slight, frail-looking person.” At his final public appearance in November 1848, less than a year before the end, he managed to play “with his usual brilliance.”</p>\n",

The Tory aristocracy, which understood and appreciated the kindred Southern planter class, looked forward with satisfaction to the possible downfall of democracy anywhere. Many English liberals also favored the South, for their favorite doctrine then was free trade, and the South seemed to be deeply committed to a free trade policy. English manufacturers hoped that a direct exchange of Southern cotton for English wares would be facilitated by the success of the Southern army.</p>\n\n<p>The North, however, was not without its friends in England. Some reformers, although distressed at the newly adopted tariff policy of the United States, saw clearly that a Northern victory must result in the abolition of slavery.

With the issuing of the Emancipation Proclamation, the number of Northern sympathizers was greatly increased. The mill workers of Manchester, in spite of the suffering that the failure of the American cotton supply had caused them, urged a complete \"erasure of that foul blot upon civilization.\" To some extent, perhaps, British sympathy for the North was purchased by the greater need for Northern wheat than for Southern cotton. In addition, there can be no doubt that the profits of neutrality were widely regarded as preferable to a hazardous war over the issue of Southern independence.</p>\n",
