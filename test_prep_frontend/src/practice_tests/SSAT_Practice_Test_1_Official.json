In the early twentieth century, the two-foot tall Australian marsupial was hunted almost to extinction for its furry pelt. Only since the koala was declared a protected species in the late 1920’s has it made something of a comeback. So perhaps the koala could be forgiven for thinking that life might be more bearable if it were closer to the size of a real bear.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In fact, it once was. Rooting around a southern Australian cave in 1985, spelunker Graham Pilkington uncovered a fossilized jaw fragment of a creature later identified as a giant koala, which probably inhabited the continent more than 1 million years ago. The jawbone and front molars are about twice the size of those of a present-day koala. This suggests that the creature was more than three feet tall and weighed between 45 and 65 pounds. Not exactly a grizzly bear, but about two to three times as heavy as modern koalas.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Still, as the curator of fossils at the South Australian Museum explains, this larger size may have been a mixed blessing. Although the giant koala was perhaps better equipped to ward off foes, it probably subsisted on the same diet of eucalyptus leaves its descendants favor. Not all eucalyptus branches could have supported that much weight, so dining out could have been an adventure for a giant koala. Worse still, late in the Pleistocene period, a series of droughts ravaged southeastern Australia, wiping out many species including the giant koala. Hardier and requiring less sustenance, only smaller members of the koala family survived.</p>\n</div>\n",

It is the changing needs of the patient, as they develop in the course of the operation, that determine what everybody does. Say a small artery is cut and begins to bleed. The bleeding artery gives a simultaneous command to the three members of the team, all of whom have been watching the progress of the operation with equal attention. It says to the surgeon, “Get your hand out of the way until this is controlled.” It says to the instrument nurse, “Get a hemostat ready,” and it says to the assistant, “Clamp that off.” This is the the highest and most efficient type of cooperation known.

Humorous persons, if their gift is genuine, are always agreeable companions and they sit through the evening best. They have pleasant mouths turned up at the corners. To those corners the great Master of marionettes has fixed the strings and holds them with nimble fingers that twitch them at the slightest jest. But the mouth of a merely witty person is hard and sour until the moment of its discharge. Nor is the flash from a witty person always comforting, whereas a humorous person radiates a general pleasure and is like another candle in the room.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t</tr>\n\t</tbody>\n</table>\n",

Farmers, carpenters, and miners live on a different level from philosophers, poets, and historians; the invention of the wheelbarrow, the windmill, and the horse collar were innovations of little interest to scholars on their high, intellectual plateau. This gulf between theory and practice, between those who labor and those who think, has perverted the writing of history, giving it a one-sided, intellectualized interpretation. The humanists, for instance, when they peered backward from the fifteenth century, concluded that the thousand years following the collapse of Roman rule had been a dark age. It seemed so to them because arts and letters and other manifestations of the high intellectual tradition had declined when the Roman Empire in the West disintegrated and had not revived until their own day.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had the humanists paid more attention to technological developments, they might have modified their conception of the “dark ages,” for the practical inventive genius of the European peoples continued to function although the Roman Empire dissolved. Medieval craftsmen devised and introduced labor-saving devices which even the Greeks and Romans had failed to invent when their civilization was flourishing so brilliantly in the thousand years between 600 BCE and 400 CE. In some respects medieval society was neither static nor stagnant despite the contempt the humanists conceived for it.</p>\n</div>\n",
