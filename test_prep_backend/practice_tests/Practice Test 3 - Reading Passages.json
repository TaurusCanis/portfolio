At midday he went to Dan Burke\u2019s and took his lunch\u2014a bottle of lager beer and a small trayful of arrowroot biscuits. At four o\u2019clock he was set free. He dined in an eating house on George\u2019s Street where he felt himself safe from the society of Dublin\u2019s gilded youth and where there was a certain plain honesty in the bill of fare. His evenings were spent either before his landlady\u2019s piano or roaming about the outskirts of the city. His liking for Mozart\u2019s music brought him sometimes to an opera or a concert.

In the early twentieth century, the two-foot tall Australian marsupial was hunted almost to extinction for its furry pelt. Only since the koala was declared a protected species in the late 1920\u2019s has it made something of a comeback. So perhaps the koala could be forgiven for thinking that life might be more bearable if it were closer to the size of a real bear.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In fact, it once was. Rooting around a southern Australian cave in 1985, spelunker Graham Pilkington uncovered a fossilized jaw fragment of a creature later identified as a giant koala, which probably inhabited the continent more than 1 million years ago. The jawbone and front molars are about twice the size of those of a present-day koala. This suggests that the creature was more than three feet tall and weighed between 45 and 65 pounds. Not exactly a grizzly bear, but about two to three times as heavy as modern koalas.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Still, as the curator of fossils at the South Australian Museum explains, this larger size may have been a mixed blessing. Although the giant koala was perhaps better equipped to ward off foes, it probably subsisted on the same diet of eucalyptus leaves its descendants favor. Not all eucalyptus branches could have supported that much weight, so dining out could have been an adventure for a giant koala. Worse still, late in the Pleistocene period, a series of droughts ravaged southeastern Australia, wiping out many species including the giant koala. Hardier and requiring less sustenance, only smaller members of the koala family survived.</p>\n</div>\n"}}, {"pk": 19, "model": "test_prep_backend.readingpassage", "fields": {"test": 3, "text": "<table cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"lrn-highlightable\">\n\t\t\t<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many people suppose the situation in an operating room to be like this: The atmosphere is tense; scarcely a word is spoken.

The bleeding artery gives a simultaneous command to the three members of the team, all of whom have been watching the progress of the operation with equal attention. It says to the surgeon, \u201cGet your hand out of the way until this is controlled.\u201d It says to the instrument nurse, \u201cGet a hemostat ready,\u201d and it says to the assistant, \u201cClamp that off.\u201d This is the the highest and most efficient type of cooperation known.

This gulf between theory and practice, between those who labor and those who think, has perverted the writing of history, giving it a one-sided, intellectualized interpretation. The humanists, for instance, when they peered backward from the fifteenth century, concluded that the thousand years following the collapse of Roman rule had been a dark age. It seemed so to them because arts and letters and other manifestations of the high intellectual tradition had declined when the Roman Empire in the West disintegrated and had not revived until their own day.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Had the humanists paid more attention to technological developments, they might have modified their conception of the \u201cdark ages,\u201d for the practical inventive genius of the European peoples continued to function although the Roman Empire dissolved.
