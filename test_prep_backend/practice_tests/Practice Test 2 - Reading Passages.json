In this hard school Cook learnt his sailor duties. No better training could have been found for his future responsibilities. Here he learnt to endure the utmost rigours of the sea. Constant fighting with North Sea gales, bad food, and cramped accommodation, taught him to regard with the indifference that afterwards distinguished him, all the hardships that he had to encounter, and led him to endure and persevere where others, less determined or more easily daunted by difficulties, would have hurried on, and left their work incomplete.</p>\n\n<p>Few sailed for the purpose of exploration pure and simple; and even those who started with that view found, when embarked on that vast expanse, that prudence dictated that they should have a moderate certainty of, by a certain time, falling in with a place of sure refreshment. The provisions they carried were bad at starting, and by the time they had fought their way through the Straights of Magellan were already worse; water was limited, and would not hold out more than a given number of days.

The teachers, trying as best they could to sound the Japanese or Italian pronunciation, called us by the names of our parents used. None of us ever suffered for speaking our native languages.

I astounded the class with the story of my travels on a stagecoach, which my classmates had seen only in museums. Miss Hopley herself would express openly her wonder about these matters.

I polled my supporters and concluded that I had voted for Homer and so had he.

Every day when he came back from his stroll, he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the road. At first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind that made him ask this question, but at last we began to see he was desirous to avoid them.

One quote often used by Holmes is, \"When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\"</p>\n\n<p>In \"A Scandal in Bohemia,\" Holmes deduces that his friend Dr. Watson had got very wet lately and that he had \"a most clumsy and careless servant girl.\" When Watson asks how Holmes knows this, Holmes answers: \"It is simplicity itself.

In 1775, a church leader in France developed a system of finger spelling. One hand gesture stood for each letter in the alphabet. This allowed deaf users of sign language to spell out words by forming shapes with their hands. Americans were introduced to sign language in the early 1800s, when Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, a minister, traveled to Europe in search of a way to help his neighbor's deaf child learn to communicate. In Europe, Gallaudet learned about the French system of sign language and began adapting it for Americans. Upon his return to the United States, he started the first school for the deaf in the country. Over time, Gallaudet's system became what we know now as American Sign Language, or ASL.</p>\n\n<p>Sign languages vary across the world, and most cultures have a system of signing. Although they do not use spoken words, sign languages are otherwise much like any other language. Rules of grammar govern the language's use. For instance, in an English sentence, the subject typically goes before the verb. In ASL, however, the order of gestures can vary. In spoken languages, a speaker can use his or her tone of voice to communicate different emotions, but sign languages rely on other tools, such as facial expressions, to accomplish this. For instance, signers can change the statement \"You are hungry\" to the question \"Are you hungry?\" by changing their body language (for instance, by leaning forward) and using their eyebrows.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Over the past two centuries, ASL has grown and become more complex as more people have learned it. Schools for deaf students, including a university name for Thomas Gallaudet, have been established. American Sign Language is now the fourth most common language used in the United States.</p>\n"}}, {"pk": 14, "model": "test_prep_backend.readingpassage", "fields": {"test": 2, "text": "During these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the craft, and as often I asked about Captain Ahab and how he was and when he was going to come on board his ship.
